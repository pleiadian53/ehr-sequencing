Now, before we move on to the next phase, let's do a git push. 

We've had documents for git setup in other projects such as genai-lab: /Users/pleiadian53/work/genai-lab/dev/git/github_setup_guide.md

Similar to this setup routine, can you help me run git init, write commit message and

use 'gh' to create a repo (this repo used to be called tpheno but I'd like to create a new one called ehr-sequencing by the name of this project). 

Among other steps, finally, help me complete our first push for this project.

gh is installed under conda's base environment. Is it not ideal? If so, we can install gh system-wise. Not sure what the best practice is. You seem to have trouble finding it every time!
