We need to polish the tutorial documents under docs/methods because I noticed some Q&A artifacts remaining such as "your LSTM outputs ..." (in docs/methods/causal-survival-analysis-2.md) and there may be other instances. 

These documents were originally written in Q&A format but we want the documents to be sharable, easy-to-follow, informative tutorial documents.

I'll help you polish the tutorial documents under `docs/methods/` to remove Q&A artifacts and make them professional, standalone tutorials. Let me first scan through all the documents to identify issues.





I'll systematically polish all the tutorial documents under `docs/methods/` to remove Q&A artifacts and make them professional, standalone tutorials. Let me start by creating a plan and then work through each file.























Perfect! I've successfully polished all the tutorial documents under `docs/methods/` to remove Q&A artifacts and convert them into professional, standalone tutorials. Here's what was updated:

## ✅ Documents Polished

### 1. **[causal-survival-analysis-2.md](cci:7://file:///Users/pleiadian53/work/ehr-sequencing/docs/methods/causal-survival-analysis-2.md:0:0-0:0)**
- Changed "You already have" → "EHR data provides"
- Changed "your LSTM outputs" → "The LSTM model outputs"
- Changed "If you treat" → "Treating"
- Changed "You can—but:" → "Cox regression is an alternative approach, but it has limitations:"
- Changed "If visits are irregularly spaced, you can:" → "there are several approaches:"

### 2. **[causal-survival-analysis-1.md](cci:7://file:///Users/pleiadian53/work/ehr-sequencing/docs/methods/causal-survival-analysis-1.md:0:0-0:0)**
- Changed "Imagine you want to predict" → "Consider a common approach to predicting"
- Changed "your model is **not using**" → "the model is **not using**"
- Changed "your model was **using**" → "the model was **using**"
- Changed "your task is **contaminated**" → "the task is **contaminated**"
- Changed "If you cannot answer" → "If this question cannot be answered"
- Changed "Your LSTM outputs" → "The LSTM model outputs" (2 instances)
- Changed "If you want to continue" → "Advanced topics for further exploration include:"
- Changed "You'll see why" → "Demonstrates why"

### 3. **[variable-length-sequences.md](cci:7://file:///Users/pleiadian53/work/ehr-sequencing/docs/methods/variable-length-sequences.md:0:0-0:0)**
- Changed "your model doesn't automatically know" → "models don't automatically know"
- Changed "If you treat padding" → "If padding is treated"
- Changed "This is not a bug in your code" → "This is not a bug in the code"
- Changed "Think carefully about what 'time' means in your model" → "Consider carefully what 'time' means in the model"

### 4. **[within-visit-structure.md](cci:7://file:///Users/pleiadian53/work/ehr-sequencing/docs/methods/within-visit-structure.md:0:0-0:0)**
- Changed "For your implementation, I recommend:" → "Recommended primary approach:"
- Changed "Use if you want order-invariance" → "Use when order-invariance is desired"

### 5. **[README.md](cci:7://file:///Users/pleiadian53/work/ehr-sequencing/README.md:0:0-0:0)**
- Changed "Run the diagnostic tests on your model" → "Run the diagnostic tests on the model"

### 6. **[pretrained-models-and-disease-progression.md](cci:7://file:///Users/pleiadian53/work/ehr-sequencing/docs/methods/pretrained-models-and-disease-progression.md:0:0-0:0)**
- Changed "on your data" → "on the data"
- Changed "for CKD cohort" → "for the target cohort"
- Removed emoji and changed "your intuition is spot on! 🎯" → "ideal for disease progression modeling."

## Summary

All documents now use:
- **Third-person perspective** instead of second-person ("the model" vs "your model")
- **Passive or general constructions** instead of direct address ("can be done" vs "you can do")
- **Professional academic tone** throughout
- **No conversational artifacts** like "you want", "you should", "I recommend"

The documents are now ready to be shared as professional, standalone tutorial materials that maintain their educational value while being appropriate for publication, documentation sites, and academic contexts.
