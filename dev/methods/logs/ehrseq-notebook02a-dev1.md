Can you go through the discrete-time survival analysis notebook directory: 



/Users/pleiadian53/work/ehr-sequencing/notebooks/02_survival_analysis



and I have the first follow-up question: 



Given this modeling/simulation assumption: 

@ehr-sequencing/notebooks/02_survival_analysis/TUTORIAL_02_synthetic_data_design.md:80-95 



do you think using the number of medical codes (a mixture of many different types) as a proxy for comorbidity burden may need a bit of rerefinment? I can imagine LOINC codes, diagnostic codes may be represenative and informative but other codes really depend. For example, Some "small diseases" may natually need more variety of medicine and therefore more drug codes, which don't necessarily reflect severity? 



Can you document your suggestion also as a supplementary document to notebooks/02_survival_analysis/TUTORIAL_02_synthetic_data_design.md? Maybe under 02a_<topic>.md? you can name the topic appropriately
