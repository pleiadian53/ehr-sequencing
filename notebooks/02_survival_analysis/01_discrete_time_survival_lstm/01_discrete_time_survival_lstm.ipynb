    "\n",
    "### What is the C-index?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **concordance index** (C-index) measures how well a survival model ranks patients by risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**: If patient A has an event before patient B, the model should assign patient A a higher risk score.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "For all pairs of patients $(i, j)$ where:\n",
    "- Patient $i$ has an observed event (not censored)\n",
    "- Patient $i$'s event time $T_i < T_j$ (earlier event)\n",
    "\n",
    "The pair is **concordant** if: $\\text{risk}_i > \\text{risk}_j$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{C-index} = \\frac{\\text{concordant pairs}}{\\text{comparable pairs}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "- C-index = 1.0: Perfect ranking (all pairs concordant)\n",
    "- C-index = 0.5: Random ranking (coin flip)\n",
    "- C-index = 0.0: Inverse ranking (all pairs discordant)\n",
    "\n",
    "### C-index in Discrete-Time Survival\n",
    "\n",
    "In discrete-time models, we predict **hazard at each visit**:\n",
    "- $h_t$ = probability of event at visit $t$ given survival up to $t$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk score** = cumulative hazard = $\\sum_{t=1}^{T} h_t$\n",
    "\n",

    "### Why Not Use AUC?\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC (Area Under ROC Curve) is for binary classification at a fixed time point.\n",
    "\n",
    "C-index handles:\n",
    "- **Variable event times**: Patients have events at different visits\n",
    "- **Censoring**: Some patients are lost to follow-up\n",

    "- **LSTM hidden states**: Recurrent layers maintain state across sequences\n",
    "- **Batch processing**: Multiple patients processed simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local vs. Cloud Training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Local Testing (MPS/Small GPU)**:\n",
    "- Use `MAX_PATIENTS=200` for subset training\n",
    "- Reduces memory from ~20GB to ~5-8GB\n",
    "- Good for: debugging, hyperparameter tuning, code validation\n",
    "- Limitation: May not achieve best performance on small data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud Training (RunPods/Vast.ai)**:\n",

    "  - RTX 4090 (24GB): ~$0.40/hr on RunPods\n",

    "- Good for: final training, performance evaluation, production models\n",
    "\n",
    "### RunPods Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create account**: https://www.runpod.io/\n",
    "2. **Select GPU**: Choose RTX 3090 or RTX 4090 pod\n",
    "3. **Choose template**: PyTorch 2.0+ with CUDA 11.8+\n",
